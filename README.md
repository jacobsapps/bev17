# bev17

Supplementary sample code to my blog series on async testing

Now updated for iOS 17!

Including...
- Unit testing view models that use the Observation framework  
- Unit testing the Swift Data persistence framework 
- Upgrading the data access layer to implement various data retrieval strategies
- Xcode 15 String Catalogs 

As of May 2024, the API on which this app depends was discontinued. But hey, all the tests still work...
